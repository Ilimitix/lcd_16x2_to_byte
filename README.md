# LCD 16x2 to Byte Converter

The LCD 16x2 to Byte Converter is a simple Python application that allows you to convert the state of each block in an LCD 16x2 display into a byte sequence. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interactively toggle the state of each block and generate the corresponding byte representation.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    tkinter library (usually included with Python)

# Usage

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

    Clone this repository or download the source code files.

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

    Run the following command to start the application:

    bash

    python lcd_16x2_to_byte_converter.py

    The GUI window will appear, showing a grid of blocks representing the LCD 16x2 display. Each block consists of eight primary squares that can be toggled between black and white.

    Toggle the primary squares of each block to represent the desired state.

    Click the "Conv" button above each block to convert and display the byte sequence for that block in the result area.

    To clear the content of a block, click the "/" button next to it.

    The generated byte sequence will be displayed in the result area. You can copy and use it in your Arduino or microcontroller projects.

    Repeat the process for each block as needed.
